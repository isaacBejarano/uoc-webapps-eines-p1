          Western Saharan cuisine comprises the cuisine of Western Sahara, a disputed territory
          in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by Morocco to the north, Algeria to
          the extreme northeast, Mauritania to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the
          west. The Western Saharan cuisine has several influences, as the population of that
          area (Sahrawi), in their most part are of Arabic and Berber origin. The Saharawi
          cuisine is also influenced by Spanish cuisine owing to Spanish colonization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food is primarily imported into Western Sahara, as minimal rainfall in the territory
          inhibits agricultural production. Indigenous sources of food include those derived
          from fishing and nomadic pastoralism. The labor and business in these indigenous
          provisions of foods are also a primary contributor of income for the territory's
          population, and are among the primary contributors to the economy of Western
          Sahara.

          In this category you will find current aproaches to conservate the Sahara ecosystem,
          agriculture as well as initiatives to revert the desertification, e.g. The Great Green
          Wall.

          The Tamarix is an evergreen tree, native across North, East, and Central
          Africa; and the nectar from its blossoms produces high-quality honey
          with a unique taste; due to the drought- and salt-tolerant properties of the tree,
          it
          could be planted as an agroforestry species, as well as for reclamation of marginal
          lands; a vegetative propagation method for the tree using the aeroponics technique
          has
          recently been developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tree is known to be very tolerant of salts. It has been found that it excretes
          concentrated
          salty water from glands on its leaf surfaces; the water evaporates leaving a crust of
          crystals
          containing more than ten salts. Most of the crystals fall off, but the crystals of at
          least one,
          lithium sulphate, remain stuck on the leaves. These particular crystals swell with the
          small amount
          of humidity in the atmosphere at night, and the leaves absorb the moisture.

        <h2>Fauna</h2>
        <p>
          In this category you will find information about the most curious and wild animals
          that
          one can find in the vast Sahara: for example the Sahara Silver Ant -which can
          survive
          the extreme temperatures of the desert due to its natural refrigerating
          mechanisms,
          the The Dromedary Camel -which is essential to the Sahrawi cuisine and transport
          within
          the desert, the Saharan horned viper -always effectively camouflaging with the
          sand- or
          the Sahara's and World's smallest canine -The Fennec Fox.
