					The Sahara, the great desert (in fact, the third largest in the world, after Antarctica
					and the
					Arctic) whose surface reaches almost the nine and a half million kilometers, spanned
					several
					countries on the African continent, located to the North of it. As you might expect, in
					this vast
					territory, there are several cultures and customs, but all have something in common: tea
					and their
					ceremony. A real ritual.
