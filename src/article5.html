          Imagine a living symbol of hope, the largest living structure on the planet, one that
          stretches
          8,000km across Africa, ushering in a new era of sustainability and economic growth.
          Launched in 2007 by the African Union, the game-changing African-led Great Green Wall
          initiative
          aims to restore the continent's degraded landscapes and transform millions of lives in
          the Sahel.

        <p>
          This ambitious project is being implemented across 22 African countries and will
          revitalize
          thousands of communities across the continent. It brings together African countries and
          international partners under the leadership of the African Union Commission and the
          Pan-African
          Agency of the Great Green Wall. More than USD 14 billion has been raised and pledged to
          support this
          game-changing initiative.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>

        <p>
          The GGW initiative's ambition is to restore 100 million hectares of currently degraded
          land;
          sequester 250 million tons of carbon and create 10 million green jobs by 2030. This will
          help
          communities living along the Wall to grow:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            one of humanity's most precious natural assets: fertile land
          </li>
          <li>
            economic opportunities for the world's youngest population
          </li>
          <li>
            food security for the millions that go hungry every day
          </li>
          <li>
            climate resilience in a region where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else
            on Earth
          </li>
          <li>
            a new world wonder spanning 8000km
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Public awareness campaign</h2>

        <p>
          Growing a World Wonder is UNCCD's campaign to raise awareness about the Great Green
          Wall.
        </p>

        <p>
          The campaign aims to inspire a global popular movement to deliver this urgent
          African-led dream by
          2030. It centers on the core narrative that the Great Green Wall is a compelling symbol
          of hope
          addressing challenges ranging from climate change to food security, migration to
          resource-driven
          conflict. It is a concrete example of man and nature working together to create a unique
          legacy - a
          new world wonder for the next generation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The campaign aims to boost global awareness of the initiative in public spheres, policy
          debates, as
          well as media and cultural sectors with a clear view towards inspiring long-term public
          and private
          investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has already reached millions of people through media outreach, events, and civil
          society
          involvement. Among the future highlights is the release of the Great Green Wall
          documentary produced
          in collaboration with the Oscar-nominated filmmaker Fernando Meirelles and Malian
          singer Inna Modja.
